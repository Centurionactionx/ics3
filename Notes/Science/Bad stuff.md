Constipation
- Too much water absorbed from shit
- Can't come out easily
- Eat fibre to help
- Drink water

Diarrhea
- Advanced shit
- Usually caused by infection
- No water absorbed

Emesis (Vomiting)
- Expulsion of stomach contents

Heartburn
- Acid goes to lower esophogus and makes a burning sensation
- Deal with by using antacid (against-acid)

Circulation
- Pulmonary - heart and lungs
	- Pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood
	- Pulmonary vein is the only vein that carries oxygenated blood
- Cardiac - heart and lower body
- Systemic - heart to brain

Blood Vessel Structure:
- Artery - thick, high blood pressure
- Vein - thin, low blood pressure
- Capillaries very thin, low blood pressure

Blood:
- Red blood cells - transports oxygen
- white blood ccells - fights infections
- platelets - blood clotting
- Plasma - Carries blood cells

Heart:
- 4 chambers
- 4 valves
- 2 
- 2 

Atherosclerosis:
- Plaque forms on artery wall. 
- makes circumference smaller
- Less blood flows
- Limits elasticity 

Full blockage:
- Blood clot results
- Results in no oxygenated blood reaching heart (Heart Attack)
- Heart cells start dying
- No oxygen reaches brain (Stroke)
	- Coronary bypass: skipping blocked artery
	- Angioplasty: inflated balloon compressed plaque against walls
	- Stent: metal net that pushes plaque

Hypertension:
- High blood pressure for long time from plaque blockage
- Overuse leads to thickening of heart muscles which is bad
- 

Coronary Artery Disease
- Coronary Arteries: feed heart itself
