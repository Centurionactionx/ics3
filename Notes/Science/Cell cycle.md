1. Interphase
	1. G1 - Cell starts out in first phase of life
		- Chromosomes in the form of chromatin and only one chromatid
	2. S - Chromatids duplicate
		- Sister chromatids form on the centromeres
	3. G2 - Centrioles duplicate
2.  Mitosis
	1. Prophase
		- Nuclear envelope starts disappearing
		- Centrioles move to poles
		- Spindle fibers form
		- Chromosomes become thicker and are now in condensed form
	2. Metaphase
		- Chromosomes move to equator
		- Spindle fibers attach to centromeres of chromosomes
	3. Anaphase
		- Chromosomes split into two
		- Spindle fibers pull them to the poles by the centromeres
		- Number of chromosomes is not halved. Stays the same
	4. Telophase/Cytokinesis
		- Nuclear envelope starts coming back
		- Cell starts to physically split in two.
