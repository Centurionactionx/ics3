Definition: What makes cells different from each other

Stem cells have no specific function. They can become anything they want. They haven't become specialized yet.

Ebryogenisis: a term to describe making an embryo
An ebryo is basically a baby in the womb. Has different definitions

Zygote: first single cell that has complete dna from both parents. Is a diploid
- Eg. Chicken egg

Haploid: half of each chromosome full set thing
- Eg. Unfertilized egg

Zygotes immediately develop. It is called `cleavage`. 
- Each development is called blastomeres. 
- Gets to 8 cells or more, called `morula`. 
- After `morula` is `blastula` which is has a hollow mass inside. 
- In humans, `blastula` develops into a `blastocyst`. Blastocyst has cells on one side

Blastocyst has an inner cell mass
- Inner cell mass becomes embryo (baby)
- Trophoblast becomes placenta
- Placenta is the sack that the fetus is sitting on. Comes out in afterbirth.

Zona Pellucida is the sack that the embryo is enclosed in. Embryo will hatch from it as long as it attaches to the wall of the uterus.

Gastrulation
- Outer: Ectoderm - Skin
- Middle: Mesoderm - Blood
- Inner: Endoderm - GI tract, lungs

Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC):
- Totipotent: Zygote and Morula
	- Can still form a baby even if taken out

- Pluripotent: Blastula and Blastocyst
	- Can't still form a baby even if taken out
	- Will grow without a placenta

Somatic Stem Cells. Adult Stem Cells or Multipotent:
- Families of cells
	- Bone Marrow

Unipotent:
- Only makes one type of cell

Terminally differentiated:
- Cannot differentiate at all

Tissues:
- Muscle Tissue
	- Cardiac - heart, fatigue resistant, striation
	- Skeletal - Limbs, not fatigue resistant, striations
	- Smooth - Organs that contract, fatigue resistant, no striations
- Nervous Tissue
	- Typically neurons
	- Sends electrical signals
- Connective Tissue
	- Eg. Bone, cartilage, fat, blood
	- Cells held together by a liquid or other substances
- Epithelial Tissue
	- Anything that has layers or is lining
	- Classifications
		- Simple vs Stratified
		- Squamous vs Cuboidal vs Columnar
