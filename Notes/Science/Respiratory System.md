Nasal Cavity:
- Cleans air with tiny hairs
Pharynx (throat):
- Merges nasal cavity with oral cavity with trachea and esophagus
- Epiglottis is the door (usually open)
Larynx (voice box):
- Soft bone 
- Houses vocal cords
Trachea (windpipe)
- Soft bone
- Bumpy
- Prevents trachea from collapsing
- Lined with cilia
	- Brush mucus
Bronchi
- Goes into bronchioles
- Hairy, wet and bony
Alveoli
- Hollow cavities increase surface area
- 1 cell thick
Breathing
- Muscles: Diaphragm, ribcage
- Diaphragm contracts (moves down)
- Rib cage expands

Laryngitis
- Inflammation of vocal cords
Bronchitis
- Inflammation of bronchi
- Caused by virus or bacteria
- Cilia immobilized
Bronchiolitis
Asthma
- Constriction of muscles around bronchiole
- Closes off breathing passage, obstructs airflow
- Inflammation does not obstruct airflow, asthma does
- Bronchodilator (puffer)
Pneumonia
- Infection of lungs
- Alveoli gets filled with fluids
Smoking
- Injures the cilia
- Creates tar 
Emphysema
- Alveoli becomes brittle
- From smoking
- Loses surface area, walls fused together
