- Nucleus
- Nuclear envelope
	- Surrounds nucleus and controls passage inside and out
- Centrioles
- Rough ER
	- Folded interconnected membrane
	- Site for protein synthesis
	- Basically connected to the nucleus
	- Makes proteins from ribosomes
	- Sends stuff to the Golgi body
- Smooth ER
	- Folded interconnected membrane like the Rough ER. In circles though
	- Site for lipid synthesis
	- Lipids are like fats
- Golgi apparatus
	- Folded interconnected membrane
	- Modifies proteins and liquids from ER
	- Packages finished products into vacuoles for transport
- Mitochondria
	- DO NOT call the powerhouse of the cell
	- Produces Energy
	- Surrounded by double membrane
	- Lots of Folds
	- Energy production center. Converts energy to food through a process called cellular respiration
- Chloroplasts
	- Double membrane
	- Traps light energy to make sugars (glucose)
	-  Basically just photosynthesis
	- Stores starch
- Cell Wall
	- Rigi wall composed mostly of cellulose
	- Specific to plan cells
	- Gives shape and structural support to plant cells
