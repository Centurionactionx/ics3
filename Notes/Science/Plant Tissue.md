- Dermal tissue
	- Outer layer of plant
- Vascular Tissue - Plant's blood vessels
	- Xylem
		- Tubes made of dead cells
		- Direction of travel is up
	- Phloem
		- Made of living cells
		- Transports sugars made in leaves
		- Direction of travel is bidirectional because at night and winter it has to bring sugar up
- Ground Tissue
	- Palisades
	- Guard cells
- Sugars travel through Phloem:
	- Glucose: sugars made in leaves. monosaccharide
		- Immediately made from converting sunlight
		- Single sugar
	- Sucrose: Double glucose
	- Starch: polysaccharide thing
		- Stored in roots
- Cellular respiration: converting sugars into energy for use. needs oxygen. produces co2

In Spring:
- No photosynthesis
- Cellular respiration
- Sugars traveling back up

In Summer:
- More leaves, more sugar which is sent down to roots for storage in winter

1. Primary Growth - height and roots spread
	1. Controlled by Apical meristem which is at the top and bottom
	2. Always going mitosis because its growing
	3. Root cap takes damage so it gets replaced by cells
	4. Has a terminal bud, when terminal bud is active, all other buds are inactive. Kill terminal bud, other buds grow into branches and become terminal buds
2. Secondary/Lateral/Horizontal growth - in plants thickness of trunk etc
