- Oncogene
	- A mutated gene that can turn cells into tumor cells, causing cancer
	- Prevents apoptosis ([[Cell cycle]])
	- Default state **OFF**
	- Mutation causes Gain-of-function gene turns on
	- Results in growing cells that were supposed to die
- Tumor-Suppressor Gene 
	- Regulates cell division, keeping cells in check in life cycle
	- Default state **ON**
	- Mutation causes loss of function gene to be turned off
	- Results in cells growing uncontrollably

**Results of mutation**:
- Cells spend less time in interphase
- Rapidly unwanted mitosis
- Rapid cell divison

**Carcinogens** - Factors that cause cancer
- Viral (diseases)
	- Hepatitis B (liver cancer)
	- HPV
- Ironizing radiation
	- Nuclear fallout
	- X-rays
	- Sun (skin cancer)
- Mutagenic chemicals
	- Cigarettes and smoking (lung cancer)

**Diagnosing Cancer**
- Endoscopy - Probing stuff
- X-rays - Sees through you. Sees dense stuff
- Ultrasound - Uses sound waves ðŸ¤¯
- CT/CAT Scan - X-rays but in multiple layers
- MRI - CT scan but uses radio waves
- Biopsy - Taking a sample and analyzing it

**Reducing Risk**
- Screening and stuff
- Changes to lifestyle
- Blood tests
- Self-examining

**Treatments**
- Surgery - Physically removing the tumor
- Chemotherapy - Giving drugs
- Radiation therapy - Therapy but with radiation
