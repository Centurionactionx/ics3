This week we started on a files activity which took a little bit of time. The activity was a little bit confusing but it simualted a video game where we modified the stats of two game characters to different files. We needed to both read and write to two different files. 

Afterwards, we had Test 2 which was on if statements, while loops, and for loops.

After the test, we got assigned the Emerging Tech Presentations assignment. I chose to do something related to combat.
