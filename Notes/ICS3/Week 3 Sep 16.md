#Access_contr
- Getter method - Gets information. Use getter methods instead of directly touching into the variable.
- Setter method - Sets variables to a piece of information. Use setter methods to pass in information and set a variable as that piece of information
- This creates access control which is good for things like organization.

#overload_methods
- Overload methods are like failsafes for other methods. They can have the same name, but different input types. This way if you call one of the methods without inputting anything, and then call it again but this time with inputs, then it'll run both methods as long as you have that overload present. 

#for_loops
- For loops are similar to how they are in processing. Same syntax and format for initiating them. for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
