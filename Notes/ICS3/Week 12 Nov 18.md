This week started off with us doing an in-class contest for mcpt. It was a really simple contest which I liked since it got a lot of people (including myself) motivated to do competitive programming. It also got people familiar with the MCPT contest system and how the problems in general work. 

Then we got assigned assignment 7 which required us to make a grades computer for a student. 

We also had to finish our emerging tech presentations assignment.
