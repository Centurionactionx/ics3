#parallel_programming
Parallel programming allows a program to do multiple things at once instead of the usual linear method. This is done by creating different threads of different instances of classes. This way you can run animations and other stuff like that in parallel with each other. 

We started an assignment that required us to use parallel programming. It was an assignment that required us to make 3 different scenes of animations. We used threads to run animations in parallel with each other in each of the three scenes that required us to.
