This week we finished up the plan and assignment 8 in general. It was also very busy with other things. On Tuesday we had the course selection presentations. On Wednesday I was on a field trip for science, and on Thursday I went down to the tech room to help with the course selection presentations. 

On Thursday, the culminating assignment was assigned and we finished the plan on Friday. 

On Friday, we also started keyboard listeners

#Keyboard_Listeners

For detecting keys, we require 3 different methods
- `Keypressed()`
	- Pass in `(KeyEvent e)`
	- Check if `e.getKeyCode` = whatever key you want to detect
- `keyReleased`
	-  Pass in `(KeyEvent e)`
