We started off the week with finishing up the gui assignment 6 from last week. It took us a long time because there were a lot of things that needed to be connected together. Then, we did a debrief of the sixth assignment and learned about the debugger.

#debugger
The debugger is a good way to de bug the prgram. It needs you do specify a breakpoint, which then the debugger will go to until it breaks and pauses for a moment. This is great for debugging loops to track what values your variables are at. 

#array_lists
- Lists and arrays are not the same thing
- Arrays are a fixed size in java, you cannot make it bigger or smaller
- Many advantages

- In a for loop, you can iterate to the end of the loop by saying 
  `for (int i : nums)`
