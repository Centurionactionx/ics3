#scanner
- `import java.util.Scanner`  to import scanner
- `Scanner s` You need to create a scanner object to use scanner
- `s = new Scanner (System.in)` to create a scanner
- `variable_name = s.nextLine()` to get the input for a string (example)

- We did some scanner practice problems involving strings, integers, and floating point numbers

#strings
- `string.length()` gets the length of a string 
- `string.chatAt( [int] )` prints the character at any position of the string
- `string.substring( [int] )` gets all letters from this value to the end. 
	- A range can also be inputted to grab the letters in that range
- `string.concat()` concatenates or appends anything on to the end of a string
- `string.toUpperCase()` sets string to uppercase
- `string.toLowerCase()` sets string to lowercase
- `string.indexOf( [int] )` gets the character at the int location

#Algorithmic_Planning
- Before writing code, it's good to plan ahead so it's easier for you 
- Using pseudocode to plan is a good idea
