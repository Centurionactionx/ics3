We did a decisions activity. We made a program that had three options of different stuff that it could do. 

#while_loops
- Runs so long as the condition is true. Exits if the condition becomes false
- Usefule for guard statements

#try_and_catch_block
- Try and catch blocks are used to catch an error
	- Try: try to do something, expect an error
	- Catch: contains the exception if it gets generated. If the exception is caught, the code inside the catch block runs. 
- Usage examples: opening files, getting inputs, dividing numbers
