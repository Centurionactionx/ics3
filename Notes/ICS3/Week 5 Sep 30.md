We did a decisions activity. We made a program that had three options of different stuff that it could do. 

#while_loops
- Runs so long as the condition is true. Exits if the condition becomes false
- Useful for guard statements

#try_and_catch_block
- Try and catch blocks are used to catch an error
	- Try: try to do something, expect an error
	- Catch: contains the exception if it gets generated. If the exception is caught, the code inside the catch block runs. 
- Usage examples: opening files, getting inputs, dividing numbers

#assignment5
We started assignment 5 this week since the test got postponed to the week after. This assignment required us to make a program that involved a physics equation. We needed to calculate the variable of choice from the user in this equation, with the other variables being inputted by the user as well.
